## Details

<!--
1.  Please tell us exactly how to reproduce the problem you are running into.

2.  Please attach a small application (ideally just one main.dart file) that
     reproduces the problem. You could use https://gist.github.com/ for this.

3.  Switch flutter to master channel and run this app on a physical device
     using profile mode with Skia tracing enabled, as follows:
       flutter channel master
       flutter run --profile --trace-skia

     The bleeding edge master channel is encouraged here because Flutter is
     constantly fixing bugs and improving its performance. Your problem in an
     older Flutter version may have already been solved in the master channel.

4.  Record a video of the performance issue using another phone so we
     can have an intuitive understanding of what happened. Donâ€™t use
     "adb screenrecord", as that affects the performance of the profile run.

5.  Open Observatory and save a timeline trace of the performance issue
     so we know which functions might be causing it. See "How to Collect
     and Read Timeline Traces" on this blog post:
       https://medium.com/flutter/profiling-flutter-applications-using-the-timeline-a1a434964af3#a499
     Make sure the performance overlay is turned OFF when recording the
     trace as that may affect the performance of the profile run.
     (Pressing â€˜Pâ€™ on the command line toggles the overlay.)

# The problem
Using two drawAtlas with atlas and manipulated from it at the same time gets performance issue.
Drawing either the original image or manipulated not at the same time has no performance loss. 
But drawing both simultaneously impacts performance significantly.

- It doesn't make changes whether using `drawAtlas` or `drawRawAtlas`.


## How to reproduce
  1. Load an image and draw it by `drawAtlas()`. You cannot see the issue yet.
  2. Flip the loaded image horizontally or manipulate it and then draw it by `drawAtlas()`.
  3. You can see the jank. Switching the order from (1 => 2) to (2 => 1) also has a jank.

## Reproducible repo
- https://github.com/Hwan-seok/flutter_draw_atlas_performance_issue
- You can see the issue more dramatically after adjusting the slider to around 4000~6000(it depends on testing devices' performance).

<!--
     Please tell us which target platform(s) the problem occurs (Android / iOS / Web / macOS / Linux / Windows)
     Which target OS version, for Web, browser, is the test system running?
     Does the problem occur on emulator/simulator as well as on physical devices?
-->

**Target Platform:** Reproduced on both Android and iOS. I cannot confirm others.
**Target OS version/browser:** Tested on Android 11, 12, and 13. Also iOS 14, 15, and 16.
**Devices:** Simulator, emulator, Galaxy Z flip 3, Galaxy S 10, 20, Galaxy A30, iPhone 12 mini, and iPhone 14 pro.
